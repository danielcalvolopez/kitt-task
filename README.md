This task required to develop a feature to calculate the price of a room for a given period of time (in seconds) with four different tariffs.

Price per minute: £2
Price per hour: £22
Price per day: £60
Price per week: £105

The pricing function should use the cheapest rate for given duration.

To achieve this result, I have implemented 2 different functions that achieve the same result, one in a very simplified manner, and another one looking at the different tariffs breakpoints and conditionally calculating the final price.

I have also used jest and react testing library to test the components by doing unit tests.
